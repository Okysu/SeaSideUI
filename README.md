## Features

### Fancy

We provide a fancy component library, unlike other libraries suitable for admin interfaces. We are more suitable for youthful, social products.

Although fancy, all components can be treeshaken.

### Rich Components

In fact, we've only completed half a button component so far, hahaha.

### Using TypeScript

Written entirely in TypeScript, seamlessly integrating with your TypeScript projects. There shouldn't be anyone not using TypeScript with a component library and Vue 3 together, right?

### Bizarre CSS

Our CSS is also fancy, but we won't bloat your project. No repetitive style additions, styles are automatically removed when the component is destroyed.
